    <h1>KING PETS</h1>
    <p>Life is just boring without partners and sometimes you find true friendship from animals instead of man. Different people have different pets.<br> Some have cats, dogs, parrots etc. So for kings level, I needed a pet worth my title,<strong>Dragons</strong></p>
    <h2 style="color:blue;">Why Dragons</h2>
    <p>Dragons are a wonderful creation with different beautiful species. They have good sence of hearing and sight that can enable them to get their <br>meals while deep in the sky. They are also amazing when it comes to parenting. They spend at least three to four years with their young ones.</p>
    <p>Below are reasons why I choose dragons as King's pets</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They are a Royal and Superior animal species.</li>
      <li>They are friendly to man.</li>
      <li>They barely require man's help for their survival, an <em>Indepedent</em> animal type.</li>
    </ul>
